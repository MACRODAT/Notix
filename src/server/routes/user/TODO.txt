USER AUTHENTIFICATION FOR REACT AND NODE JS

NODE JS : SOMEHOW SAVE USER_ID FOR EACH LOGGED IN IP.


REACT : KEEP A SESSION CONTAINING THE USER ID AND ITS INFO.
PAGES THAT NEED AUTHENTIFICATION WON'T BE ACCESSED WITHOUT A SESSION.


TODO :
[ ] ADD NODE JS TABLE CONTAINING THE USER ID WITH ITS IP
[ ] REACT AUTHENTIFICATION TOKENS
[ ] IMPLEMENT REDIRECT TO REFERRER
