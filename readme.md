# MOSWADA PROJECT

MOSWADA is a digital blockchain-based certification project for diplomas and academic papers. The aim is the use of a decentralised network for approving academic documents as well as diplomas. It will greatly facilitate the sharing and verification of these assets (diplomas for students, academic research papers...) 

## Concept

Personal accounts are owned by different individuals. Each has access to the block-chain, where they can contribute by approving or disapproving academic papers.
Public accounts, owned by institutions, could issue diplomas for students. These are added to the blockchain. Then they may be publicly accessible for anyone and may provide a verified certification process.
All this data is decentralized, and may be safe-kept in a centralized location as a backup.

> This project is created using react and node js.
> The block chain is run using NODE JS.
> The use of electron js
> different extensions and helpers, including react strap, 
> boostrap, and many more.
